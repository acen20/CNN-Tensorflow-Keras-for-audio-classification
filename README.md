# CNN for sound classification
MFCCs extraction of sound signals along with complete CNN model fitting and evaluations.

Note: Uncomment the MFCC extraction function to work with your own sounds. Otherwise, I have also provided a dummy dataset i.e. dataset.npy.

# About dataset.npy
MFCCs of dimension (178,44,13) where 178 are number of audio, 44 is the number of samples for each audio and 13 are number of MFCCs.
Labels of dimension (178,)
